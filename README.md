# Skywalker_Vignere_I_AM_THE_LAST_JEDI
This repository highlights an early "discovery" I made into character manipulation, and ignited a lifelong passion for cryptography, eventually leading to me to study Cybersecurity. It features the Vignere Cypher and my C++ Implementation, both the original works featured as well as an optimized version, aimed at large scale crypto - analysis.

Skywalker Vigenère: I AM THE LAST JEDI

An accidental journey into ASCII manipulation, inspired by Star Wars, cryptography, and a mind that thinks in functions.

Overview

Skywalker_Vigenere_I_AM_THE_LAST_JEDI isn’t just another Vigenère cipher—it’s the product of an unexpected discovery. While implementing the classic encryption method, I stumbled upon a fascinating way to manipulate characters using their ASCII values, unlocking a new level of efficiency in text encryption. This project showcases both the original and an optimized version of the algorithm, blending historical cryptography with modern computational thinking.

The name is a tribute to two great inspirations: Professor John Goulden, whose deep technical wisdom ignited my passion for computing, and Kadin, my husband, whose iconic response to my antics—"I am the last Jedi"—became legendary in our household.

Accidental Discovery: ASCII-Powered Optimization

What started as a standard Vigenère cipher implementation turned into a realization that direct ASCII manipulation could enhance both encryption speed and efficiency. By leveraging numerical properties of characters instead of relying solely on string indexing, the optimized version reduces computational overhead and allows for smoother, more performant encryption and decryption.

Features

C++ is strong with this one – Professor John Goulden

Why "Skywalker"?

I wanted to throw back to both Professor John Goulden and my husband, Kadin, who have inspired me and love Star Wars.

Because cryptography is like the Force—powerful, mysterious, and best understood by those who see beyond the surface. And sometimes, the greatest discoveries aren’t planned… they’re stumbled upon, hidden in the code, waiting to be unlocked.
